title: My personal website
website: "https://github.com/stbnvll/personal-website/"
description: I've relaunched my website once or twice now, but somehow I was never really happy with it. After a while it always bumbled along and rarely got new content. Most of the time I just wanted to try out a new framework or a special lib. Once that was done, I subconsciously checked the whole thing off. With this sweetie here that should be different.
